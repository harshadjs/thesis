* HTTP Over XIA
** HTTP Content Negotiation
Content may be available in different representations. HTTP allows
user agents to choose the representation that they like the most! This
is called "Content Negotiation"

** HTTP Compression

** We are using HTTP but what about the headers?

*** What goes in HTTP request header?

*** Header fields associated with content chunks
- Content Encoding

** Some important headers

*** Accept [REQUEST]

Content format that the client can understand.

Example:

_Accept:text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8_

HTML preferred, otherwise serve as xhtml / xml. Otherwise serve in any
format that you would like.

:tricky: The parameter 'q' is a rough estimate of user preference
about the type of the content.



** URL Formats?

** Different Content Parameters

HTTP clients fetch content with different parameters. E.g., content
encoding, expires etc. Some parameters are specific to content whereas
others not really i.e. they are metadata about "request / response /
message"

** CID or HTTP?

Web browser can fetch content using CID protocol or HTTP
protocol. Application can be made _aware_ of the fact that it is using
CIDs and not HTTP, or it can be made _agnostic_ of that fact. Which
one to go for?

- _CID-Aware_


- _CID-Agnostic_


** Webserver and client
*** Who publishes content chunks?
** [FUTURE] SPDY?

3 options ofr ptuing stuff
Make a decision
** Project meeting
- Look at Patrick's Thesis
