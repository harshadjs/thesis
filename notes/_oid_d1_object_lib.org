* Using Application Independent Object Library
** Idea
- An user-space object library provides object level API to
  applications
- Object library breaks objects provided by applications into chunks
- It forms a root chunk which points to all other chunks in the object
- Object library interfaces with the network layer by chunk-level APIs
  that the network provides

** Pros
- Cacheable meta-data: rootchunk is cacheable
- A good interface for chunk-agnostic applications: with a very
  minimal effort, a chunk-agnostic application can use the notion of
  objects
** Cons
- Extra chunk level RTT to fetch the rootchunk
