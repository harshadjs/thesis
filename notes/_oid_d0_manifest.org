* Using Application Level Manifest
** Idea
- Applications define their own chunk collection mechanism. Something
  like manifest files.
- Applications first fetch the manifest file over SID and then fetch
  all the chunks
- OID Computation is inside the application
- Applications indicate the network layer about the OID explicitly
** Diagram
[[./img/oid-d0-manifest.pdf]]
** Pros
- No extra (redundant) RTT at chunk level
** Cons
- Needs a significant change in the application
  - to compute OID and install it in the network
  - to explicitely fetch the manifest file before actually fetching
    the content
- Manifest file is not cacheable
