* Goals
- Give the chunk-agnostic applications the ability to talk in terms of
  objects
- Let the network layer be aware of relationship between chunks
* Possible Design Options

* Chunk-Aware and Chunk-Agnostic Systems <2015-09-29 Tue>

  Content Distribution  Applications can be broadly  classified into 2
  categories:
  - Chunk-Aware Applications
  - Chunk-Agnostic Applications

  Chunk-Aware  Applications take  decisions on  chunk granularity  and
  Chunk-Agnostic  applications   take  decisions  on  object   /  file
  granularity.

  Let's  look in  a little  depth at  both these  systems and  how XIA
  serves them.

** Chunk-Aware Systems

*** Motivation of Chunking in Chunk-Aware Systems

- Bittorrent: Achieve *Parallelism* by fetching different parts of a
  file from different sources Chunk ID is hash of chunk content;
  Achieve *self certification*

- Netflix: Achieve *Quality Control* by fetching parts of a video file
  of variable quality; Achieve *self-certification*

*** Motivation of Chunks in ICN / XIA

- Caching of chunks by reducing latency
- Achieve Self-certification

*** Does a chunk from a Chunk-Aware system map to chunk in ICN/XIA?

- If Yes: Do goals of chunking in XIA and in chunk-aware systems
  match?
- If No: Big problem: A chunk in application maps to multiple chunks
  on N/W. We need to explicitly store this mapping somewhere.
- NEEDS RESEARCH: But assume yes!


** Chunk-Agnostic Systems

They talk in terms of Files. e.g., HTTP GET /xyz.com/ab/cd.pdf

*** Is XIA as of now a good fit for these apps?

Imagine:
We have a HTML page that contains an image
--
<img src="/abc/def.png">
--

If the user wants to use CID principal, how?  Rely on DNS like
service which provides all the chunks belonging to this file Embed
a list of chunks in HTML Write all the chunks to a manifest file
and add src=“.../def.png.manifest” so that browser knows that the
chunks should be fetched using CID principal

- Disadvantages of all of these:

  - All of the above are a lot of work for application.  Network can
    not make use of locality

  - So, as of now, XIA is not a great fit for chunk-agnostic
    applications. But, wait...

*** How about OIDs ? or Network Layer Objects?

Network layer provides aggregation mechanism for an object. Thus, it
knows about the object and not just chunks. Now it can take decisions
based on the locality too! Yay!

*** OID Specification

- Routing
- Caching
- Design
- API
- Simplifies RIDs too

** About Thesis
- Apps determine chunk sizes arbitrarily. But it has a great impact on
  caching  performance. Network  layer should  perform chunking  OR at
  least it should provide some the application some hints.

- In Chunk-Aware systems, if there is  no notion of objects, then what
  about locality?  They need  that too.  Especially bittorrent  as the
  main   purpose    of   it    performing   chunking    is   achieving
  parallelism. While being  able to do that, it does  not want to give
  away locality.

- File-system level deduplication can avoid a lot of problems

** Ideas

*** Comparison of various Internet Architectures
What are  various dimensions in  which we can compare  Internet archs?
Privacy? Performance? Evolvibility?  We can  go usecase by usecase.  3
aspects: Code, RFC level,

TODO:  Maybe I  can study  the use  case of  the web  across different
architectures?

*** Video
DASH-JS: HTTP  video player.  Can we predict  the throughput  based on
history of various client-server pairs?

*** Storage medium selection

*** CID + Privacy
1. Encrypt_with_common_key(content)
2. Ecnrypt_with_user_specific_key(common_key)
