\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Periodic Checkpoints}
The evaluation will be based on periodic checkpoints and the final
outcome. In section \ref{timetable}, I have sketched out a rough
timetable. At every step, we will have a checkpoint.
\subsection{Weekly XIA Meetings}
The XIA group organizes meetings every week on Fridays. I will present
my progress in those meetings periodically.
\subsection{Final Grading}
The final grading will consist of following factors primarily:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Novelty of Ideas:} This captures the quality of
  arguments made in the thesis.
\item \textbf{Contribution to XIA project:} I will make every effort
  to contribute to the XIA project by getting my prototypes approved
  and finally merged in the XIA code base.
\item \textbf{Final Deliverables:} The final grade will also depend
  upon the final deliverables such as a possible SIGCOMM submission.
\item \textbf{Periodic Checkpoints:} Last but not the least, periodic
  checkpoints will play an important role in the final grade.
\end{itemize}
