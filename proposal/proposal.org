* Introduction
  - All FIAs propose in-network caching
	\cite{weinsberg2006putting}
  - But no one really knows
	- How would webpages look like
	- How would name service work
	- Tradeoffs between privacy and performance
	- APIs that these caches would provide
	- Content routing
* Background
  - NDN
  - XIA
* What will you do
  - Study in context of XIA
  - Study some of the problems mentioned above and propose solutions
  - Define Caching APIs
* Evaluation
  - Promising arguments about at least 2 of the above questions
  - Running prototypes
* Deliverables
  - Paper
  - Simulators
  - Contribution to XIA
* Expected Timetable
  - Work done so far
  - Summer
  - Fall 2
