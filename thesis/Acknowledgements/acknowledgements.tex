Working on master's thesis was my first real research experience. I
thoroughly enjoyed it. It taught me to think about problems in a
different way. I would like to thank everyone who directly or
indirectly supported me throughout this wonderful journey.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Professor
Peter Steenkiste for his support and guidance throughout the duration
of the project. He was always available to answer my questions and
show me the right way. His continued support over the past two years
has been crucial in this accomplishment. I would also like to
acknowledge Professor Srinivasan Seshsan who served as my thesis
reader and shared valuable feedback on the ideas.

I would like to thank the entire XIA research group for sharing
valuable time to time feedback on my work. I loved being a part of the
group. I would also like to thank Dan Barrett who helped me with
understanding the huge codebase and with setting up various
experiments. His door was always open whenever I ran into a trouble
spot.

Also, I would like to thank Saurabh Kadekodi for many meaningful
discussions that shaped ideas in the thesis.

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents and
my brother for providing me with their continuous encouragement and
unfailing support. This work would not have been possible without
them.
